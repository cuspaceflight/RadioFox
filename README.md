CU Spaceflight Autorotator (Trackotron)
======================================

A project to control the Alfaspid antenna rotator to automatically get balloon
positions and point an antenna at the payload.  

Includes a user interface to choose which payload should be tracked by the
Trackotron system.  

A sensor board is also included to be attached to the Yagi antenna in order
that the GPS position of the Trackotron, as well as its current azimuth and
elevation angles, can be determined.
